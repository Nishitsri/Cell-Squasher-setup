This tutorial allows users to program a cell squasher setup and interface it with a microscope.
The primary goal of this device is to apply a steady and uniform compressive stress on a slab of hydrogel while simultaneously performing high-resolution live imaging of cells squashed between the gel and a glasscoverslip. 
The system is therefore automated to keep the stress constant within the stated constraints. A mismatch of ∼10 Pa in the desired mechanical load is appropriate. Considering a typical gel sample (1% [wt/vol] agarose gels, 2-mm thickness), a 10-Pa change in the mechanical stress corresponds to a plunger displacement of the order of 1 μm. We therefore choose a motorized actuator with a minimum incremental motion of 0.2 μm. The load cell must also be able to sense variations of load of the order of 10 Pa. A Futek sensor, LSB200, and a low-cost 16-bit analogue-to-digital convertor (ADC; Adafruit, ADS 1115) connected to a Raspberry Pi computer provide a required range and precision.
In addition to characterizing cell behavior under compressive load, the same setup can be used to measure the mechanical properties of the gels under which cells migrate.
